    <!-- Clan Rules & Guidelines -->
    <section id="rules">
        <h2>Clan Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Respect all members.</li>
            <li>Participate in clan wars.</li>
            <li>No cheating or exploiting game mechanics. Traders are not welcome, and rightfully frown upon.</li>
            <li>Stay active on the Game. We will assume you have become a ghost if you are unactive for more than 30 days, and you will be kicked.</li>
            <li>Donate ONLY if the gold you have cannot help your figher directly! 
                (If you have any amount of gold that you can no longer invest, consider donating it to the clan coffers.</li>)
                (tip: always check for available talents, purchasable items, hideout upgrades, stats additions, etc. before ensuring you can no longer spend your gold on anything).
                It's better to be in the coffers of the guild if you have no use for it, and you will deny gold to the werewolves.</li>
            <li>Clan ranks will be given based on gold contribution & activity.</li>
            <li>Contribution is not mandatory, but as we advance in the game will help your overall stats because I will always try to keep all of the rituals active. </li>

    <!-- Vengeance Raids -->
    <section id="raids">
        <h2>Vengeance Raids</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>What are Vengeance Raids?</strong><br>
            When a TKO member is attacked—whether at the House of Pain or through a regular assault—we respond with a coordinated Vengeance Raid. The name of the enemy responsible will be posted here. Any member within battle range is encouraged to strike back and will be recognized for their bravery. A Hall of Fame will honor those who avenge their clanmates.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If you’ve been attacked:</strong><br>
            If you’re targeted by an enemy and cannot post a guild message due to your rank, please contact GM <strong>Dealer</strong> in-game. The enemy’s name will be added to our list so others can assist in retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If you’ve avenged a clanmate:</strong><br>
            If you defeat an enemy who attacked a TKO member, notify GM <strong>Dealer</strong> to be added to the Hall of Fame. If you can post guild messages, please share your victory with the clan. Admins and the Guild Master regularly review member stats and descriptions—if you mention your act of vengeance in your profile, it will be recognized and celebrated.
